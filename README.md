## RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an AI framework that combines the strengths of traditional information retrieval systems (such as search and databases) with the capabilities of generative large language models (LLMs). By combining your data and world knowledge with LLM language skills, grounded generation is more accurate, up-to-date, and relevant to your specific needs
